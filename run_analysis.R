## BUILD FINAL TABLES
## -----------------------------------------------------------
## build the final table with columns: 
##   subject_group - what group the subject belongs to
##   subject - id number for the subject
##   act_name - name of the activity being measured
## followed by one column (culumns 4..69) for each one of 
## the target measurements (66 columns in total). The values 
## of these 66 columns are the measurement that was obtained 
## for that variable in one of the intances when the given 
## subject was performing the given activity.
final_table <- 
      data_frame(c(rep("train", nrow(measurements_train)), 
                   rep("test", nrow(measurements_test))))
names(final_table) <- "subject_group"
final_table <- cbind(final_table, all_subjects)
final_table$act_name <- all_activities$act_name
final_table <- cbind(final_table, all_measurements)

## Transfor the final table in one in which the 66 columns
## corresponding to the target measurements are now inserted
## as values. Hence, the final table will have 5 columns: 
##  subject_group
##  subject
##  act_name
##  measurement_type - describes the target measurement
##  measurement_value - the value of the target measurement
final_table <- gather(final_table, "measurement_type", 
                      "measurement_value", 4:69)

## At this moment, each row of final_table has the 
## the measurement value (measurement_value) that was
## obtained for the particular measurement (measurement_type)
## in one instance in which the particular subject (subject)
## was performing the given activity (act_name). 

## Now group final_table the attributes subject_group, subject, 
## act_name, measurement_type
final_table <- tbl_df(final_table)
gfinal_table <- group_by(final_table, subject_group, subject, 
                         act_name, measurement_type)

## -----------------------------------------------------------
## GENERATE THE FINAL TIDY DATASET WITH THE AVERAGE OF EACH 
## TARGET VARIABLE FOR EACH ACTIVITY AND EACH SUBJECT
## -----------------------------------------------------------
## extract the final tidy data set corresponding to the summary 
## of mean values of each variable different type of measurement 
## for each activity and each subject
summary_of_means <- 
      dplyr::summarise(gfinal_table, 
                       mean_value = mean(measurement_value))

## sort the previous table by subject, act_name, measumrement_type
summary_of_means <- arrange(summary_of_means, 
                            subject, act_name, measurement_type)

## -----------------------------------------------------------
## SAVE FINAL TIDY DATASET TO DISK
## -----------------------------------------------------------
## save summary table to disk 
write.table(summary_of_means, "summary_of_means.txt",
